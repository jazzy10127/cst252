		<p> Hello my name is Jasmine Hernandez and this is my CST 252 website. I am 19
		years old and this is my second year at CSUMB. Some of my favorite hobbies are sleeping and
	drawing. I am a very family oriented person and love spending time with my three nephews. I
have a white cat named Fabrizio and a white dwarf/lion haired rabit named chad. Chad's hair
grows like crazy so i have to cut it almost every week and brush his hair out every couple days.</p>
