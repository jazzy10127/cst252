			<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p> Use new css tags for our websites</p>
		</nav>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p> I had a lot of problems with my imagewith sizing, shadow box and transform tag. Another issue I had was with my fonts. I tried putting in a new font but and added all the links but it doesn't seem to be working. </p>
		</nav>

			<h2> Results</h2>
			<nav class=paragraph>
			<p> I got the hover and transform to work but they move at seperate times and degrees even though they have the same tag. Font links are still not working.  </p>
